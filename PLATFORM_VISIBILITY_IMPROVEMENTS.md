# 🎯 Platform Visibility & Feature Discovery Plan

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**Problem:** All features exist but aren't discoverable from landing page or initial experience!

**Impact:** Users can't see what the platform does without creating an account and exploring

---

## 🔍 WHAT EXISTS (But Isn't Visible)

### ✅ Features We Have (Hidden):
- 40+ complete features
- Parent dashboards with child activity tracking
- Task assignment and approval workflow
- Points and rewards system
- Photo upload for task completion
- Class enrollment system
- Coach management tools
- Analytics dashboards
- Achievement system
- Calendar views
- Messaging system
- And much more!

### ❌ What Users See:
- Landing page (beautiful but generic)
- Login/Register screens (now modernized!)
- **Nothing shows the actual platform capabilities**
- No screenshots, demos, or previews
- No obvious value proposition

---

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED

- Before/After family organization
```

- "Assign to multiple kids at once!"
