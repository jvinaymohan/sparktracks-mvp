## ✅ FINAL FIXES DEPLOYED (Based on Your Testing)

### 1. ✅ Enhanced Coach Onboarding
**Issue:** After profile creation, coaches saw generic welcome screen  
**Fixed:** Custom dialog now appears with:
- ✨ Welcome message
- ✨ Quick-start guide
- ✨ Direct links to "Dashboard" or "Manage Students"
- ✨ Tip highlighting student management

### 2. ✅ Student Management Visibility
**Issue:** "No way to create/add students"  
**Fixed:** Feature was already there, now prominently highlighted:
- ✨ "Manage Students" button (top right of coach dashboard)
- ✨ Welcome dialog points to it
- ✨ Can create students with custom or auto-generated passwords
- ✨ Search, edit, reset passwords all available

### 3. ✅ Coach Calendar Fixed
**Issue:** "Coach calendar shows child tasks"  
**Fixed:** Created dedicated coach calendar:
- ✨ New route: `/coach-calendar`
- ✨ Shows ONLY coach's classes
- ✨ Color-coded by class type (weekly, monthly, one-time)
- ✨ Quick actions: Edit, View Students, Mark Attendance
- ✨ Empty state guides to create classes

### 4. ✅ Early Access Messaging
**Issue:** Remove "free forever" language  
**Fixed:** Updated all messaging:
- ✨ "Join Early Access" (not "Sign Up Free")
- ✨ "Claim Your Spot" (not "Get Started Free")
- ✨ Purple callout explaining lifetime offer
- ✨ Clear feedback exchange positioning
